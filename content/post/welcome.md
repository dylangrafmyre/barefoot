Welcome to **Barefoot DevOps** and as they say in Hawaii, **Aloha!**

This blog will be about lessons, yak shaves, and my adventures in web application development and cloud operations.

I am a developer at [ShakaCode](http://shakacode.com). The ShakaCode team specializes in web applications built on top
of Ruby on Rails and React.

My current focus on ShakaCode client projects, ShakaCode projects plus personal projects has me learning, working with, and
deploying to production the following:

### Operation Systems
1. Linux
2. Windows
3. OS X

### Languages
1. Ruby
2. Javascript
3. Bash
4. Powershell

### Frameworks/Runtimes
1. Ruby on Rails
2. React
3. Node

## CI/CD
1. Snap CI
2. Circle CI
3. Travis CI
4. Codeship

### Automation, Config Management, and Deployment tools
1. Packer
2. Terraform

### Development Environments
1. Vagrant
2. Docker

### Containers
1. Docker
2. Turbo.net

### Container Schedulers
1. Docker Swarm
2. Kubernetes
3. Hashicorp Nomad

### Cloud Platforms
1. Amazon Web Services
2. Heroku
3. Google Cloud Platform
4. Docker-Cloud
5. Digital Ocean

### Monitoring and Logging
1. New Relic
2. Loggly


I have to focus for certain periods on just specific environments, tooling, services and platforms, I will be using this blog as a
helpful reminder about yak-shaves, tooling usage, the differences in production deploys between cloud providers or maybe TDD differences between `ruby`, `javascript`, and `powershell`. Or who knows, a personal notepad, to help with all the information we need to learn in this crazy, cloud native world.

Lots of my favorite tools are written in `Go`, and I would like to contribute back to the open source projects of those tools and the container ecosystem. This is why I picked [**Hugo**](http://gohugo.io) for a static, website engine. I will chronicle my process of leaning [**Golang**](https://golang.org/) and working on getting my first pull request merged into one of my favorite `Go` open source projects.

I am looking forward to learning and hearing from anyone that reads the posts. Please feel free to correct any mistakes and give advice on a better way to solve a problem or tackle an issue. Feel free to reach out and "talk story".

A Hui Hou Kakou.
